Release notes for 3.7.0.12 (17-09-2025)

Changes in Thanos and Motion4Sim outputs (updated ui scaling and solved several bugs in serial)
Added MIDI out to update midi values on devices that accept it (experimental)
Solved other bugs like crash caused by graphics trying to represent invalid numbers
  
--------------------------------------

Release notes for 3.7.0.11 (10-09-2025)

Changes in the behaviour of Update

Release notes for 3.7.0.10 (10-09-2025)

General:
  Many bugs solved, and many internal changes
  Some modules still working without the scale updates
  
UI:
  Dark mode and UI scale
  Solved several bugs in joystick, keyboard and midi used as controllers for the UI
  You can adjust any numeric control, checkbox or button with one of those
  Just right click in the UI control to assign a hot control
  VTOL VR now with the corresponding mod in the Steam VTOL VR Mod Loader workshop (not VTOL VR workshop)

Filters:
  New loop filters
  Use variables anywhere
  Make custom variables by assigning a macro to a name (Edit->Custom Variables)
  Solved several bugs in the variables
  
Sources:
  Updated Falcon BMS for latest changes
  Added Wreckfest 2
  Solved bugs in games detection, launch and patch
  
Known problems and bugs:
  Many to solve yet! Still BETA
  
--------------------------------------

Release notes for 3.7.0.9 (29-11-2024)

Rigs:
  Added some pr√© definitions for hexapods (temporary solution)
  Limited gain to a range between 0 and 1 (for safety reasons)
  
Sources:
  MSFS solved bug causing connection problem.
  VTOL VR now with the corresponding mod in the Steam VTOL VR Mod Loader workshop (not VTOL VR workshop)

Known problems and bugs:
  MSFS enable/disable motion in crash is not working!
  
--------------------------------------

Release notes for 3.7.0.8 (25-11-2024)

General:
  Solved bug in DIV operation.
  Added MAXSPEED and MAXACCEL filters (WIP, needs testing).

Sources:
  Added Elite Dangerous(thanks to Wagnard hooks that are updated frequently)

Poses:
  Adjusted size of tires (was wrong with scale on windows)
  
Rigs:
  2DOF rotating now similar to Mover 3.5.3 (swap and swap swapped added).

Known problems and bugs:
  Thanos and Motion4Sim are stil WIP.
  Pausing outputs while transitioning to connect/disconnect can cause jumps!
  Missing features of 3.5.3 that are still WIP.
  Crash in when opening default source/game/vehicle using high precision timer

--------------------------------------

Release notes for 3.7.0.7 (22-11-2024)

General:
  Revert to .net8 (some problems with tasks...)
  New code for serial that should solve the detection of some hardware.
  Naming of the devices should be better. After the first detection some devices might be renamed on a second detection.

Sources:
  Optimized air/ground code
  Added Falcon 4.0 BMS
  Added MSFS 2024 (same as MSFS 2020, just adding image and links to start/stop MSFS 2024).
  Solved bug causing thread to pause while trying to connect to Simconnect.
  Solved bug in image rotation (kept wrong image in some situations).

Outputs:
  Corrected bug when pausing the data stream. Now the data flow stops.
  Keep autoconnect checked when we loose connection due to an error.
  Motion4Sim 
	Added shutdown button.
    We can now select where the motion cueing is done (Mover or M4S).
	If M4S, we are sending the rig pose instead of the actuators position (use the just pose rig, but any other rig also works)
    Corrected bugs while testing for 24 bits actuators.
    Corrected bug in key for direct actuators.
    Corrected bug causing serial data problems (might have some yet).
  Thanos:
    Corrected bugs while testing for 16 bits actuators.
    Corrected bug in key for direct actuator.

Known problems and bugs:
  Thanos and Motion4Sim are stil WIP.
  Pausing outputs while transitioning to connect/disconnect can cause jumps!
  Missing features of 3.5.3 that are still WIP.
  Crash in when opening default source/game/vehicle using high precision timer
