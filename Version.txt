Release Notes:

General:
New menu code to avoid the Windows default shortcuts behaviour (interfering with hot keys).
Most of the diagram connections are now enabled (ui is slower and needs optimization).
Added custom variables. We can now define an operation or variable and give it a short name to reuse it in multiple places (Menu->Edit->Custom variables).
Solved several nasty bugs in hot keys.
Solved several small bugs.
Enabled Mover version verification on startup (adds item to the menu to download the latest release).
New serial code allowing when possible the use of the same port in multiple modules (sources and outputs).

Sources:
Added F1 24.
Added slip angle to sources (angle between vehicle dislocation and vehicle direction, good for traction loss).
Added Condor 3.
Reworked the WIT source with new serial code a better error handling.

Poses:
Work on the rpm source to solve vibration on disconnect transition. Still not solved!

Rigs:
